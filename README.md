# CSCI3410-Databases
The system provides the following functions:
1. Provide a menu so that the user can check the metadata of the database.
2. Provide insertion and deletion for each relation. Print a message showing detailed
reasons why the insertion failed. Particularly, for the deletion on employee table, if the target employee is a
department manager or working on a project. On deletion, provide a choice for the user to decide if the deletion should be continued or rejected.
3. Provide a query menu that allows a user to input query command (SQL commands)
and retrieve information from the database. Show the returned result with column
attributes.
